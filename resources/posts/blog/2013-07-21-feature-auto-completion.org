#+title: Feature: auto-completion

Mon-Ouie from Github kindly pointed at the fact that clojure-complete
library is enough to enable auto-completion in REPLy and Emacs. Even
while the completion in REPLy worked decently, Emacs completion
provided by ac-nrepl was obscenely slow. Curious about the roots of
such big difference, I investigated both clojure-complete and ac-nrepl
and found what was the issue. First, clojure-complete was full of
reflection cases, which haven't hampered it much while on JVM, but
really mattered on Android. Second, ac-nrepl called the backend many
times for different kinds of completions (vars, namespaces, classes
etc.). Again, it can be afforded in conventional REPL, but since every
REPL request on Android is kind of slow, altogether it results in
massive completion latency.

Long story short, I wrote [[http://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment][Compliment]] and achieved decent completion
speed. You might even want to use it with =ac-auto-start t= (start
completion automatically), though even the slightest lag annoys me so
I turned it off. Completion by TAB is just enough for me.

The auto-completion I ended up with by much resembles the original
complete-core/ac-nrepl. You type in stuff, a menu with candidates
appears, next to menu there is a documentation for the current
candidate. I tinkered with the documentation more to reduce response
times by introducing caching on both sides, so the docs are really
snappy.

The limitations are mostly related to classes completion. Currently
only classes that are imported into the current namespace and their
methods can be completed. This may change if I manage to parse Android
javadocs on the computer and complete from there.

See for yourself how it looks like.
