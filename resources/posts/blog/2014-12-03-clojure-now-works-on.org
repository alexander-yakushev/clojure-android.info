After a short hiccup, when Clojure applications couldn't be installed on the
newest Android 5.0 version, we finally have a solution. Tireless [[https://github.com/AdamClements][@AdamClements]]
and [[https://github.com/lorettahe][@lorettahe]] have discovered a bug in Android that prevents proxying abstract
classes from Clojure. Using the patches they provided I updated the relevant
packages so that you can now install your apps on Lollipop. Here they are:

- =org.clojure-android/clojure 1.7.0-alpha4=
- =org.clojure-android/tools.nrepl 0.2.6-lollipop=
- =neko 3.1.0-preview3=

The implemented changes involve stubbing clojure.pprint because it relied on
=proxy=. This is a temporary measure until the new version of Android is
released (the bug is already fixed in their development branch). You should also
steer clear of proxying abstract classes until then.
