Neko is finally transferred to [[https://github.com/clojure-android/neko][clojure-android]] organization and is
now considered an official mainline fork. I hope this will reduce the
confusion that people had when they stumbled upon the old version,
last time updated one year ago, in the organization. The old link under
[[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko][alexander-yakushev]] still works and is automatically redirected to the
new one.
